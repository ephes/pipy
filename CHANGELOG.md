# Changelog

All notable changes to pipy are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/); `/changelog` renders these
entries oldest-first, and a version bump shows the new entries at startup.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Pi-style interactive TUI/editor workflow depth for the product tool-loop
  terminal (`pipy repl --agent pipy-native --repl-mode tool-loop`), all through
  pipy-owned stdlib boundaries with no new runtime dependency and the inline
  (no-alternate-screen) contract preserved:
  - `@` file picker with Pi exact/prefix/substring ranking (not fuzzy) over a
    bounded, `.git`/ignored-aware workspace walk, and general Tab path
    completion (prefix-match, dirs-first, `~/` expansion, space-quoting) that is
    a no-op in prose.
  - Local `!`/`!!` shell shortcuts reusing the real bash execution boundary,
    with a bash-mode input affordance, context (`!`) vs no-context (`!!`)
    recording, and Escape cancellation of a running command.
  - `Shift+Tab` thinking-level cycling (off→minimal→low→medium→high, clamped to
    model reasoning support, recorded as a `thinking_level_change` native-tree
    entry) and `Ctrl+P`/`Shift+Ctrl+P` model cycling over the scoped/available
    set.
  - `Ctrl+O` tool-output expansion and `Ctrl+T` thinking-block fold as renderer
    view flags (the thinking fold persisted to `hideThinkingBlock`).
  - Queued steering / follow-up during active turns (`Alt+Enter` follow-up,
    `Alt+Up` restore-to-editor), a pending-messages region, steering-then-
    follow-up drain order, and steering interruption via the existing cancel
    token.
  - Clipboard image paste (`Ctrl+V`, owner-only temp file under an image
    reference root) and terminal drag-drop file references; image bytes never
    reach the metadata archive.
  - A `/scoped-models` multi-select overlay defining the Ctrl+P cycle set, new
    `/settings` actionable rows (tool-output/thinking folds, thinking-level
    cycle, scoped models), and startup hints + `/hotkeys` advertising every
    binding.
  - The terminal-native mouse-selection invariant: the renderer never enables
    xterm mouse tracking, so click-drag selection over scrollback keeps working.
  - New gate `scripts/parity_checks/tui_workflow_conformance.py --json` drives
    the real product PTY path and proves all of the above (plus non-TTY
    fallbacks and archive privacy) deterministically.

### Fixed

- A `/…` slash command or `!…` bash shortcut submitted with Enter mid-turn now
  runs locally (matching Pi's editor `onSubmit`): it interrupts the turn and
  dispatches through the normal local-command path instead of being steered to
  the model. Only ordinary prose becomes a steering message, so the queue lanes
  hold prompt text exclusively.
- Queued steering/follow-up messages that begin with `/` or `!` (e.g. an
  `Alt+Enter` follow-up) now reach the model verbatim when the queue drains.
  Previously a queued line starting with a slash-command or `!`-shell prefix was
  re-interpreted as a local command on delivery and silently dropped from the
  conversation; drained messages are provider-visible prompt text and bypass
  local-command dispatch (they still resolve any `@file`/`@image` references).
- Moving the caret (`←`/`→`/`Home`/`End`) now dismisses the `@`/path completion
  popup. Previously the popup stayed anchored to the caret offset where it
  opened, so accepting after a move spliced the candidate at a stale offset and
  duplicated/corrupted the active token; it reopens on the next edit.
- Aborting (Escape/Ctrl-C) or restoring (`Alt+Up`) while a queued turn is
  draining now brings the remaining queued prompts back to the editor. Once a
  turn settled (or steering promoted), the queue moved into an internal drain
  that the restore path ignored, so the not-yet-delivered prompts stayed hidden
  and kept auto-submitting to the model after the cancellation; they are now
  restored along with the steering/follow-up lanes.
- `Ctrl+V` clipboard-image reads are bounded and isolated: the helper's stdin is
  `/dev/null` and the read enforces a wall-clock deadline, so a misbehaving
  clipboard tool (one that hangs or never closes its output) can no longer
  freeze the editor or consume terminal keystrokes.
- Tab path completion no longer offers ignored/generated entries (e.g.
  `node_modules/`) or symlinks escaping the workspace for workspace-relative
  directories, matching the `@` picker and the read policy; explicit
  absolute/`~/` navigation the user points Tab at is still listed as-is.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-03

### Added

- Pi-style settings/config/keybindings system for the native runtime:
  - Layered `settings.json` (global `<config>/settings.json` on the
    `PIPY_CONFIG_HOME` → `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/pipy` → `~/.config/pipy` chain, plus
    project `.pipy/settings.json`) with Pi migrations, one-level deep merge with
    project precedence, CLI/env overrides, parse-error isolation, and
    field-scoped lock-guarded writes that preserve unknown keys.
  - `keybindings.json` with the default editor/app binding table (single key
    spec or array of alternatives), legacy-name migration, malformed-file
    fallback to defaults, and `/hotkeys` rendered from the resolved manager.
  - Settings drive `defaultProvider`/`defaultModel`, `theme`, `quietStartup`,
    `promptHistory.enabled`, and `autocompleteMaxVisible` at startup; `/settings`
    reports the resolved configuration.
  - System-prompt inputs: `--system-prompt`, repeatable `--append-system-prompt`,
    `SYSTEM.md` / `APPEND_SYSTEM.md` auto-discovery, and `--no-context-files`/
    `-nc`.
  - `retry.*` feeds the provider HTTP retry policy and `compaction.enabled`
    gates auto-compaction.
  - Scoped models: `enabledModels` + `/scoped-models` (view/set/clear/cycle) and
    Ctrl+P forward cycling.
  - Resource enablement via `pipy config` (`-pattern`/`+pattern` over
    `skills`/`prompts`/`themes`/`extensions`) and `enableSkillCommands`.
  - `/reload` re-reads settings, keybindings, resources, and theme.
  - `/changelog` and the `--version` surface.
- Provider/model catalog closeout for the native runtime:
  - Catalog-backed provider construction now covers the OpenAI-compatible Chat
    Completions family, implemented catalog-constructed non-completions
    families, `pipy run` one-shot construction, and startup
    `--native-provider`/`--native-model` resolution through the shared resolver.
  - The provider catalog conformance gate covers Verification-Plan items 1-24
    with deterministic fake HTTP/product-path checks and no network access.
- True active-turn provider-request cancellation for the native tool loop:
  Escape and Ctrl-C each thread a per-turn `CancelToken`
  (`pipy_harness.native.cancellation`) into `ProviderPort.complete(...)` that
  shuts the live `urllib`/SSE connection down — during the header wait or the
  body/stream read — so the worker's blocking read raises
  `ProviderCancelledError` instead of finishing the request; the worker is then
  best-effort joined and the loop renders Pi-style red `Operation aborted`
  without appending an assistant/tool observation. The socket-shutdown read
  path tolerates the `http.client` `_close_conn` shutdown race (a concurrent
  `fp = None` surfacing as `AttributeError`) by mapping it to cancellation only
  when the token is cancelled, so an aborted body read cannot leak a spurious
  provider error.
- Python SDK/headless embedding documentation for `pipy_harness.sdk`, including
  the current one-shot in-process surface, fake-provider default, current limits,
  and relationship to planned JSON/RPC automation.
