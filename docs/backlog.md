# Pipy Backlog

Status: planning index

This backlog records the current implementation direction at a task-slice
level. It is not a full issue tracker. Use it to choose the next small,
reviewable change while keeping the source-of-truth design constraints in
`docs/harness-spec.md` and `docs/session-storage.md`.

## Done

- Durable file-based session archive with active/finalized lifecycle.
- `pipy-session` recorder, catalog, search, inspect, reflect, verify, sync, and
  conservative automatic-capture helpers.
- `pipy run` subprocess harness with lifecycle recording, conservative privacy
  defaults, changed-file path opt-in, and finalized partial records.
- Native pipy runtime bootstrap behind `--agent pipy-native` with a minimal
  provider/session boundary, internal system prompt construction, deterministic
  fake provider, and privacy-safe native lifecycle events.
- Native OpenAI Responses provider behind `ProviderPort`, selected with
  `--native-provider openai --native-model <model>`, using `OPENAI_API_KEY`,
  an injectable standard-library HTTP boundary, `store: false`, stdout-only
  final text, and privacy-safe partial archive metadata.
- Native tool boundary with explicit request/result/status, approval policy, and
  sandbox policy data, plus a deterministic fake no-op tool path that emits
  privacy-safe lifecycle events without inspecting or mutating the workspace.
- Native loop planning documented: future provider output becomes a sanitized
  internal tool-request intent before any tool lifecycle event is recorded, with
  fake/no-op execution only, metadata-only archives, and real execution,
  approvals, sandbox enforcement, retries, streaming, fallback, OAuth, provider
  registry, raw transcript import, and orchestration deferred.
- Native fake tool-intent path: fake providers can deterministically expose one
  sanitized internal no-op intent through explicit fixture metadata; native
  sessions invoke the injected no-op tool only for that safe intent, while
  provider success with no intent completes without tool events and
  unsafe/unsupported intent data is skipped with metadata-only lifecycle
  records.
- Native provider usage metadata normalization: native archives allow only
  finite non-negative normalized `input_tokens`, `output_tokens`,
  `total_tokens`, `cached_tokens`, and `reasoning_tokens` counters;
  provider-native raw usage payloads and unavailable counters are omitted
  rather than guessed.
- Native final text stdout mode decision: successful native provider final text
  remains the default human-readable stdout payload, while session
  finalization, diagnostics, progress, and errors stay on stderr; structured
  machine-readable native stdout was reserved for an explicit flag later named
  `--native-output json`, and archives remain metadata-only without model
  output.
- Native post-tool provider turn decision: the current native fake intent path
  remains bounded to one provider turn plus optional one fake no-op tool
  invocation; any post-tool provider turn is deferred until permission prompts,
  sandbox enforcement, and real tool-result observation semantics are designed,
  and future metadata must remain summary-safe and metadata-only.
- Native structured stdout flag contract decision: current `pipy-native`
  stdout remains successful provider final text only by default, while
  structured automation output is reserved for explicit `--native-output json`
  emitting one final metadata-only JSON object with no raw prompts, model
  output, provider responses, tool payloads, stdout, stderr, diffs, file
  contents, secrets, credentials, tokens, private keys, or sensitive personal
  data.
- Native structured stdout JSON mode: `pipy run --agent pipy-native
  --native-output json` emits one final versioned metadata-only JSON object
  after the native run and recorder finalization attempt complete, suppresses
  provider final text in JSON mode, includes finalized record references and
  safe capture booleans, preserves the default final-text stdout contract when
  omitted, and rejects `--native-output` for non-native agents before creating
  a record.

## Next Slice

### Native Runtime Boundary Decision After Structured Stdout

Goal: decide the next small native runtime boundary after the structured stdout
contract, while keeping the current bounded one-provider-turn plus optional
fake no-op tool path unchanged.

Candidate shape:

- choose one narrow decision slice before adding any broader native execution
  behavior
- keep `pipy-native` as the product runtime direction rather than wrapping
  Codex, Claude, Pi, or another CLI as the main path
- preserve metadata-only archives and the default native stdout/stderr contract
- keep real execution, approvals, sandboxing, post-tool provider turns, and
  broader model/tool loops deferred unless their contracts are explicitly
  selected first

Keep out of scope:

- changing the current human-readable default stdout mode
- streaming
- retries or model fallback
- real filesystem or shell tool execution
- approval prompts or sandbox enforcement
- post-tool provider turns or a general model/tool loop
- provider-side built-in tools
- raw prompt/model output storage in JSONL, Markdown, or structured stdout
- raw provider responses, tool payloads, stdout, stderr, diffs, file contents,
  secrets, credentials, or sensitive personal data in JSONL, Markdown, or
  structured stdout
- Codex, Claude, Pi, or another CLI wrapper as the main product path

Acceptance checks:

- docs name the selected next native boundary and explain why it is still
  bounded
- native default stdout remains successful final text only on success, with
  diagnostics, finalization, progress, and errors on stderr
- native behavior still uses the bounded deterministic fake/no-op execution path
- native records still pass `pipy-session verify`
- `pipy-session list`, `search`, and `inspect` stay compatible
- raw system prompts, user prompts beyond the short `--goal` metadata, model
  output, provider responses, tool payloads, stdout, stderr, diffs, file
  contents, secrets, credentials, tokens, private keys, and sensitive personal
  data are not persisted or emitted in automation output by default

## Near Term

- Select the next narrow native runtime boundary before adding broader
  execution behavior.

## Deferred

- Full native pipy agent runtime beyond the provider and tool-boundary slices.
- Codex JSONL event adapter.
- Claude integration beyond the existing conservative `pipy-session auto`
  metadata capture.
- Pi-native session inspection beyond metadata references.
- Raw transcript import with explicit opt-in and redaction policy.
- Indexed archive search or SQLite-backed query layer.
- Repo maps or workspace summaries.
- Interactive TUI.
- RPC mode.
- Multi-agent task delegation.
- Long-running dev server.
- Docs server such as Zensical.

## Explicitly Not Now

- Making Codex, Claude, or another coding-agent CLI wrapper the main product
  path.
- Storing full system prompts, user prompts, model outputs, stdout, stderr,
  tool payloads, secrets, tokens, credentials, private keys, or sensitive
  personal data by default.
- Building approvals, sandboxing, retries, streaming, OAuth, provider registry,
  raw transcript import, TUI, RPC, compaction, branching, or orchestration in
  the next native slice.

## Maintenance Notes

- Move completed slices from `Next Slice` or `Near Term` to `Done` in the same
  change that implements them.
- Keep deferred items here brief; put detailed design and rationale in
  `docs/harness-spec.md`.
- Keep archive and privacy rules aligned with `docs/session-storage.md`.
